# Image Segmentation Using U-Net

## Overview
This project demonstrates image segmentation using the U-Net deep learning architecture. U-Net is widely used in medical imaging and computer vision applications to segment regions of interest from input images. This repository contains an implementation of U-Net for binary and multi-class image segmentation.

## Features
- **U-Net Architecture**: Fully convolutional network for semantic segmentation.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable to different datasets and segmentation tasks.
- **Efficient**: Trained using modern techniques for robust performance.

## Requirements
To run this project, install the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib opencv-python
