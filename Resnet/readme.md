## Significance

Residual Networks (ResNets) are a groundbreaking innovation in deep learning, particularly for image recognition tasks. Hereâ€™s why they matter:

1. **Addressing the Degradation Problem**:
   - Training very deep networks can result in performance degradation due to vanishing/exploding gradients. ResNets solve this issue using *residual connections*.

2. **Achieving State-of-the-Art Accuracy**:
   - ResNet architectures have significantly improved accuracy in tasks like image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.

3. **Scalability**:
   - ResNet models (ResNet-50, ResNet-101, ResNet-152) demonstrate how depth enhances representation learning without compromising performance.

4. **Foundation for Advances**:
   - ResNet has become a cornerstone of modern architectures, inspiring derivatives like ResNeXt and applications in transfer learning.

5. **Widespread Adoption**:
   - Implemented across frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow), ResNets are used globally in cutting-edge AI research and applications.
